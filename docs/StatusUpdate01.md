# Status Update 01

## Progress Summary

- Successfully implemented user registration and authentication in the Android app.
- Integrated secure HTTPS communication with a self-signed certificate, including custom OkHttp client configuration.
- Debugged and resolved issues related to certificate trust, hostname verification, and server connectivity.
- Ensured registration requests include all required fields (username, email, password) and verified request payloads via Logcat.
- Collaborated with the server team to resolve a server-side issue that was causing registration failures.
- Confirmed that the app can now register and authenticate users, and that the main app functionality is restored after login.

## Key Accomplishments

- **TLS/SSL Integration:**
  - Configured OkHttp to trust a self-signed certificate for development.
  - Handled hostname verification for non-production environments.

- **Registration & Authentication:**
  - Fixed client-side request payloads to match server expectations.
  - Added error handling and improved user feedback for registration failures.

- **Debugging & Collaboration:**
  - Used Logcat to inspect outgoing request bodies and diagnose issues.
  - Communicated effectively with the server team to identify and resolve backend problems.

## Next Steps

- Continue testing all user flows (login, registration, main app features) for edge cases.
- Refactor and clean up any debug logging or temporary code used during troubleshooting.
- Prepare for production by reviewing security settings (e.g., remove permissive hostname verifier, use valid certificates).
- Update documentation as new features or fixes are implemented.

**Status:**
- The app is now able to register and authenticate users successfully.
- Main functionality is restored and working as expected after login.
